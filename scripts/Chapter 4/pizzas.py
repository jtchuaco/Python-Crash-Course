# exercise 4-1. Pizzas
# store at least three kinds of pizza names in a list
# use a for loop to print the name of each pizza
pizzas = ['pepperoni', 'all meat', 'four cheese']
for pizza in pizzas:
    print(pizza)

# modify the for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of printing just the name of the pizza
# example: I like pepperoni pizza.
pizzas = ['pepperoni', 'all meat', 'four cheese']
for pizza in pizzas:
    print("I like " + pizza + " pizza.")

# add another line outside the for loop that states how much you like pizza
pizzas = ['pepperoni', 'all meat', 'four cheese']
for pizza in pizzas:
    print("I like " + pizza + " pizza.")

print("I really love pizza.")

# exercise 4-2. animals
# make a list of animals that have a common characteristic
# use a for loop to print out the name of each animal
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish']
for animal in animals:
    print(animal)

# modify your program to print a statement about each animal
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish']
for animal in animals:
    print("A " + animal + " would make a great pet.")

# add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish']
for animal in animals:
    print("A " + animal + " would make a great pet.")

print("Any of these animals would make a great pet.")
